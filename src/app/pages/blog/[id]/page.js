      <h2>Federal Reserve's Upcoming Decision: What to Expect</h2>
      <p>The US Dollar has shown remarkable strength in recent trading sessions as markets eagerly await the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. With inflation data showing mixed signals, traders are positioning themselves for various scenarios.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Factors Influencing the Dollar</h3>
      <p>Several factors are contributing to the dollar's strength:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Economic Data:</strong> Recent employment figures exceeded expectations, showing resilience in the labor market.</li>
        <li><strong>Inflation Outlook:</strong> Core PCE inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, suggesting continued hawkish stance.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Uncertainty:</strong> Geopolitical tensions have increased safe-haven demand for the greenback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technical Analysis Outlook</h3>
      <p>From a technical perspective, the Dollar Index (DXY) has broken above key resistance at 104.50, with the next target at 106.00. The RSI indicates strong momentum without being overbought, suggesting potential for further gains.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "The market is pricing in approximately 60% probability of a 25bps rate hike. However, the focus will be on the forward guidance and dot plot projections."
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Impact on Major Currency Pairs</h3>
      <p><strong>EUR/USD:</strong> The pair has retreated to 1.0850 support level. A break below could open doors toward 1.0750.</p>
      <p><strong>GBP/USD:</strong> Cable remains vulnerable near 1.2650, with BoE's policy divergence playing a key role.</p>
      <p><strong>USD/JPY:</strong> The pair is testing 150.00 psychological level, with intervention risks increasing.</p>

      <h3>Trading Strategies to Consider</h3>
      <p>For traders looking to position themselves:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Hawkish Scenario:</strong> If Fed signals more hikes, consider USD longs against vulnerable currencies like EUR and GBP.</li>
        <li><strong>Dovish Scenario:</strong> Any hint of rate cuts could trigger USD selling, presenting opportunities in gold and commodity currencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Neutral Scenario:</strong> Range trading strategies with defined support/resistance levels may be most effective.</li>
      </ol>
